# SFIAttributePropagation
Attribute propagation using reliesOn.
When products are related via ReliesOn relationships, customers want a capability to propagate attributes from related product instances to the source product instance. 
This will help users to not configure the same attributes during cart configuration in the multiple product instances and such attributes might be required to send for downstream systems.
Instead of hardcoding such requirement for each product, this framework provides catalog driven / configurable approach which saves development effort and easy configuration for the admins.
